            Due to the atrocity and armed conflict since August 2017 in Rakhine
            State of Myanmar, the Rohingya people fled and seek refugee across
            the border in Bangladesh. They are Muslim by religion and the
            military ruler of Myanmar denied their citizenship. After entering
            Myanmar, the Bangladesh Government accepted them as refugee and
            extended all out support in the southern part of the country in Coxs
            Bazar district. GCH, being a humanitarian organization, raised their
            voice for humanity. They collected petition from thousands of the
            peoples the community to submit to congress man for further action
            against Myanmar ruler. In this process most of the people in South
            Florida willingly signed our petition to support this noble cause
            against military rulers in Myanmar.

            Frankel of the 22nd Congressional district of Florida. The
            congressional district office gladly accepted the petition and
            raised their voice in US Congress against military atrocity of
            Myanmar dictators. Later on, a resolution was passed in 116th US

            Burma and Bangladesh ensure the safe, dignified, voluntary, and
